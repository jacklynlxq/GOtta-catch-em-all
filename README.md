### Go Cheatsheet
#### Package Visibility
1. Exported identifier (akin to public access modifier) begins with capital letter, eg: `Foobar()`.

2. Internal identifier (akin to private access modifier) begins with small letter, eg: `foobar()`.

Identifer means variable name, function name, constant, statement labels, package name, or types.

#### Naming Convention: 
`MixedCaps` or `mixedCaps` rather than underscores to write multiword names.

#### Godoc
Formatting rules by official Go doc:
- Subsequent lines of text are considered part of the same paragraph; you must leave a blank line to separate paragraphs.
- Pre-formatted text must be indented relative to the surrounding comment text (see gobâ€™s [doc.go](https://golang.org/src/encoding/gob/doc.go) for an example).
- URLs will be converted to HTML links; no special markup is necessary.
