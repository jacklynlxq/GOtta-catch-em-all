### Go Cheatsheet
#### Package Visibility
1. Exported identifier (akin to public access modifier) begins with capital letter, eg: `Foobar()`.

2. Internal identifier (akin to private access modifier) begins with small letter, eg: `foobar()`.

Identifer means variable name, function name, constant, statement labels, package name, or types.

#### Naming Convention: 
`MixedCaps` or `mixedCaps` rather than underscores to write multiword names.
