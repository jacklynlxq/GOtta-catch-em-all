# Leetcode Solutions
Changing strategy to learn to solve Leetcode questions since 
I take a long time to solve even the easy questions.

Here I try to convert Java / Python solutions into Go solutions. This is not just an approach to replace the language syntax and data structure. It also involves understanding the solution in Java / Python and rewriting them in Go. 

This way I get to learn to solve the Leetcode questions as well as learning to code in Go at the same time.
